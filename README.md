# Any Old Time Frontend

The great [AnyOldTime](http://www.anyoldtime.nl) record store publishes its collection as a text file on their website. This isn't very searchable and nice to use so I created a little application to fix this.

Consists of:
- [A Spring Boot application providing an interface to query the record index](https://github.com/utwyko/any-old-time-backend)
- [A Vue.js frontend](https://github.com/utwyko/any-old-time-frontend)
